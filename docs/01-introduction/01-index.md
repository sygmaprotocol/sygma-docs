## Welcome To The Sygma Docs 

> _Sygma, like the Greek letter sigma (Î£), alludes to summation, the adding up of many things._

Sygma is an open-source interoperability layer licensed under [LGPL-3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html), designed to support the development of cross-chain decentralized applications (dApps). It abstracts the underlying complexities of blockchain bridging, enabling developers to create dApps that facilitate cross-chain token transfers and generic message passing. Sygma integrates with multiple blockchain environments, providing tools for efficient cross-chain communication. This documentation covers technical and non-technical aspects of the protocol, aiming to equip both novice and experienced developers with the knowledge to leverage Sygma effectively in their projects.

## What's Next

- Get started with our [Quick Start Guide](../03-sygma-sdk/01-index.md)
- Run your first [cross-chain token transfer](../03-sygma-sdk/04-Examples/01-Basic-ERC-20-Token-Transfers/01-EVM-EVM-example.md)
- Pass your first [generic message cross-chain](../03-sygma-sdk/04-Examples/02-GMP-Examples/01-GMP-Example-With-A-Simple-Storage-Contract.md)
- See the [environments](../08-resources/01-environments/01-index.md) Sygma is deployed in
- Look under the hood at the [architecture](../02-sygma-protocol/01-index.md)
- Integrate the [Sygma Widget](https://docs.buildwithsygma.com/sygma-widget/playground/) into your dApp
