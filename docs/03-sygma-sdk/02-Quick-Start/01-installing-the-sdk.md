The SDK is written in TypeScript and can be used in both Node.js and browser environment.

To install the SDK, you can use either npm or yarn. To install using npm, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @buildwithsygma/core @buildwithsygma/evm @buildwithsygma/substrate
```

To install using yarn, run the following command:

```bash
yarn add @buildwithsygma/core @buildwithsygma/evm @buildwithsygma/substrate
```

That's it! Once you've installed the package, you can start using it in your project.
