# Network Support

Sygma currently supports EVM and Substrate-based networks natively, with support for Bitcoin and Cosmos-based ecosystems coming soon. The currently supported networks can be found in the links below. The linked pages also contain information on supported resource types, contract addresses, and available fee schemas:

- [Testnet Network Support](https://docs.buildwithsygma.com/environments/testnet/#contract-addresses)
- [Mainnet Network Support](https://docs.buildwithsygma.com/environments/mainnet#contract-addresses)

If there is a network that is not yet supported and you would like Sygma to add support, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Qdf6GyNB5J) or fill out [this form](https://share.hsforms.com/1K4-T_yaKSp6F06FGk4wsSgnmy2x).
