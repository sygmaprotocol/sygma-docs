# Token Support

Sygma supports the ERC-20 & ERC-721 token standards, as well as native tokens in Substrate. The currently open token routes can be found in our [Environments](../08-resources/01-environments/04-mainnet.md) page.

If there is a token that is not yet supported and you would like Sygma to add support, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Qdf6GyNB5J) or fill out [this form](https://share.hsforms.com/1K4-T_yaKSp6F06FGk4wsSgnmy2x) - please include answers to the following questions:

- Are you the owner of the token in question (i.e. contract ownership)?
- Are you able to provide liquidity for the token?
- On which chains do you want to bridge the token?
- Are the tokens issued on all required chains?
- Are you interested in full-service support to bring your token to all supported networks?

Based on this information, we will provide a proposal on a bridging approach and a timeline for adding the required support into Sygma. This process usually takes a couple of days.
