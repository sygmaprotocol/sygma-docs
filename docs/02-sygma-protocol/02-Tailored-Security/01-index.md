# What Is Tailored Security?

The blockchain interoperability landscape is diverse and multifaceted. Cross-chain application users expect consistent security, speed, and reasonable fees for transactions dealing with inherently different assets, amounts, and market implications.

Consider two scenarios: a gamer transferring their character NFT and a crypto whale liquidating a large stake. These examples, while targeting the same domains (source and destination chains), have so far been restricted to bridges that operate under a uniform security model with identical fees and latency. While this one-size-fits-all approach does technically get the job done, it often leads to dissatisfaction for at least one of the users and, in the worst case, for both.

A more elegant solution is possible. Enter **Tailored Security**, a set of solutions that meet the unique demands of each transaction. This approach empowers developers to make optimal security choices based on their context. By leveraging a multi-layered framework that combines Proof of Authority, Optimistic Execution, and ZK proofs, Sygma offers unparalleled flexibility.
